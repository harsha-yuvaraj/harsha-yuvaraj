Hi! I'm currently pursuing a combined BS/MS pathway in Computer Science at the University of South Florida. I'll be entering the master's program in Fall 2025, and I'm actively seeking SWE/SDE internships for Summer 2026 to learn and contribute to impactful projects.

Check out my projects below to see what I've been working on. Let's connect!
