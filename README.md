Hi there üëãüèº! I'm currently pursuing a combined BS/MS pathway in Computer Science at the University of South Florida. I'll be entering the master's program in Fall 2025, and I'm actively seeking SWE/SDE internships for Summer 2026 to learn and contribute to impactful projects.

Currently, I'm a Teaching Assistant for the Analysis of Algorithms course at the University of South Florida. In this role, I support students in understanding complex algorithmic concepts, providing guidance on problem-solving techniques, and help enhance their analytical thinking skills.

My technical toolkit includes Python, JavaScript, SQL, C#, Java, HTML5, and CSS, along with hands-on experience in frameworks and technologies like Django, ReactJS, PostgreSQL, REST APIs, AWS, Docker, Terraform, and more.

Check out my projects below to see what I've been working on. I'm always open to meeting with people and exploring opportunities.
